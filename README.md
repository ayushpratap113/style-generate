# Custom Style Response Generator

This application generates responses in different styles (Email, Normal, Report, Feedback) based on user input and context. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with a word limit to ensure responses are concise and style-aware.
This is a follow-up to the previous project named `style-admin` and uses the styles created using the `style-admin` by processing documents in s3 bucket.
 This app is hosted at [streamlit](https://llm-style-app.streamlit.app).

## Features
- Choose from Email, Normal, Report, or Feedback styles.
- Adjust response creativity with Temperature Control.
- Set how much external knowledge the model can use.
- Limit the word count for generated responses.
- Generate context-based responses using provided input.
